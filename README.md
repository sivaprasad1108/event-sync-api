# Virtual Event Management Backend

A small, testable backend API for a Virtual Event Management Platform built using Node.js & Express. This project demonstrates role-based access, in-memory data stores, JWT authentication, password hashing with bcrypt, email confirmations using Nodemailer, and comprehensive tests using Jest + Supertest.

---

## Overview

This backend provides endpoints for user registration and login, event creation and management (organizer-only), and participant registration for events. It's intended for educational and assignment purposes and uses in-memory storage (no database). The API is asynchronous and properly tested.

Key features
- User authentication with bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for token-based authentication
- Role-based authorization (organizer vs attendee)
- Event CRUD operations protected by role and ownership checks
- Participant registration for events and email confirmation (via Nodemailer)
- In-memory data storage (simple arrays) for both users and events
- RESTful API design and async handling
- Jest + Supertest integration tests with mocked email sending

---

## Tech Stack

- Node.js (14+ / 18+ recommended)
- Express.js
- bcrypt
- jsonwebtoken (JWT)
- nodemailer
- dotenv (for environment variables)
- jest + supertest (for tests)
- uuid

## Features

- Authentication: register/login with hashed passwords (bcrypt) and JWT tokens
- Authorization: organizer vs attendee roles and route enforcement
- Event CRUD (create, read, update, delete) with ownership checks
- Participant registration for events with confirmation email trigger
- In-memory stores for users and events (suitable for assignment/test environments)
- Centralized error handling for consistent JSON error responses
- Full test coverage using Jest and Supertest and mocked email calls

---

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 14+ (Node 18+ recommended)
- npm (included with Node.js)

### Clone & install

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd event-sync-api
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file at the repository root (optional — the app will use sane defaults for local testing):

```
PORT=4000
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1h
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email-username
SMTP_PASS=your-email-password
EMAIL_FROM=no-reply@example.com
```

- If no SMTP configuration is provided, the app falls back to Ethereal (a test SMTP service) for local development and tests.
- `JWT_SECRET` is strongly recommended to be set for production environments.

---

## Running the Server

Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

During development with autoreload (requires `nodemon`):

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server listens on `PORT` (defaults to `4000`). The app mounts routes under `/api`, so the endpoints begin with `/api/`.

---

## Running Tests

This project uses Jest + Supertest to run integration tests covering authentication, event management, and registration.

```bash
npm test
```

Notes:
- Tests run in a Node environment and use `tests/setup.js` to reset the in-memory stores before each test.
- Email sending is mocked in tests to avoid reliance on real SMTP.

---

## API Endpoints

All endpoints are mounted under `/api` (e.g. `/api/register`).

| Method | Endpoint                | Auth Required | Role      | Description |
|--------|-------------------------|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| POST   | /api/register           | No            | —         | Register a new user (organizer or attendee)
| POST   | /api/login              | No            | —         | Login and receive a JWT
| GET    | /api/events             | Yes           | Any       | List events (returns basic data; authenticated preferred)
| GET    | /api/events/:id         | Yes           | Any       | Get full event detail including participants
| POST   | /api/events             | Yes           | Organizer | Create an event (organizer-only)
| PUT    | /api/events/:id         | Yes           | Organizer | Update event (organization-only & owner required)
| DELETE | /api/events/:id         | Yes           | Organizer | Delete event (owner-only)
| POST   | /api/events/:id/register| Yes           | Any       | Register authenticated user for an event

## Testing Coverage Summary

The project includes comprehensive tests to ensure the core functionality of the system:

- `tests/auth.test.js`: registration and login tests
  - Successful registration
  - Duplicate email registration returns 400
  - Successful login returns a JWT
  - Wrong password returns 401
  - Unknown email returns 401

- `tests/events.test.js`: event-related tests
  - Organizer can create event
  - Attendee cannot create events (403)
  - Unauthorized creation returns 401
  - Retrieve events list (GET /api/events)
  - Organizer can update/delete event
  - Non-owner cannot update/delete the event (403)
  - Update on non-existent event returns 404

- `tests/registration.test.js`: event registration tests
  - Successful registration (attendee can register for event)
  - Duplicate registration returns 400
  - Registration to non-existent event returns 404
  - Registration without token returns 401

Tests are deterministic and ensure the in-memory stores are cleared between test runs via a test setup file.

---

## Limitations

- In-memory storage only — not persistent. All data is lost on restart.
- Not production-ready in terms of security & robustness; lacks rate-limiting, input sanitization, and persistent storage.
- Nodemailer is configured for Ethereal or a given SMTP; production requires a real SMTP provider and environment variable configuration.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Replace in-memory stores with a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL.
- Add input validation and better error messages using `express-validator` or similar.
- Add role-based admin panel and dashboard for organizers.
- Add email templates and HTML email support for registration confirmations.
- Add real-time notifications (e.g., WebSocket) for event updates and participant changes.
- Add CI / GitHub Actions for automatic testing and linting.
